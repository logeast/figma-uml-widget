# FigJam UML Table

This widget is to create a UML table (class) diagram for FigJam or Figma. It is inspired by the [UML Diagrams template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/999008812984283340) and forked from [arthur-fontaine/figtable](https://github.com/arthur-fontaine/figtable).

## Extend with Figtable

Insert the widget, and in the widget menu you can:

- Add a column
- Remove a column
- Move up or down a column
- Each column can have a name, a type, a marker and a key ("PK" and "FK" have a custom color to help to recognize them).
