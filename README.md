# FigJam UML Table

This widget is to create a UML table (class) diagram for FigJam or Figma. It is inspired by the [UML Diagrams template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/999008812984283340).

## More Feature, more custom!

We're actively listening to and priortizing feedback so this list may change. Currently here is what we plan to support in the wedget.

### Currently Supported

- ✅ Delicater Property Menu

- ✅ Move up or down a column
- ✅ Each column can have a name, a type, a marker and a key ("PK" and "FK" have a custom color to help to recognize them).

### Future Extensions

- 🗄️ Generate table from code scripts
